# Downloading Data from the internet
Use `download.file()` that takes the url and the destination on your computer to save the file at.

Example: download the 2006 microdata survey about housing for the state of Idaho.
```{r}
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2Fss06hid.csv"
download.file(url, "data.csv") ##save in the current dir, and name the file "data.csv"
```

List the files in the current directory
```{r}
list.files("./")
```

Use `date()` to get the downloading date.
```{r}
downloadDate <- date()
downloadDate
```
Note that: 
* If the file url starts with **http** you can use `download.file()`.
* It is also okay to use `download.file()` in case of **https** and **windows**.
* But on **Mac**, you might need to set `method="curl"` to download from **https** url.
* The download duration depends on the file size.
